# COVID-19 Data Visualization in Shiny - Application Overview

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, global attention has been focused on tracking case statistics. To aid in understanding and visualizing the pandemic’s progression, we’ve developed a Shiny app that provides interactive visualizations of COVID-19 data.

## Application Features

The app consists of four primary tabs:

1. **Graphs**  
   A range of customizable visualizations, allowing users to select the type of graph that best suits their needs.

2. **Country Comparison**  
   A feature that enables users to compare COVID-19 statistics between different countries.

3. **Data Review**  
   An overview of the raw data, giving users the opportunity to explore detailed statistics.

4. **About Project**  
   Information on the project’s background, objectives, and data sources.

## Data Source

The data is sourced from daily time series summaries, which include confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. These daily reports are drawn directly from the official dataset to ensure accuracy, although any future adjustments to historical data will not retroactively affect the original daily reports to preserve the integrity of the raw data.

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series).
